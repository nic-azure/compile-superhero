- minify `.js`, `.css` and `.html` files

|Before Compile|After Compile|After Compile to min|
|-          |-       |         |
|.html      |(copied)|.min.html|
|.pug       |.html   |.min.html|
|.jade      |.html   |.min.html|
|.scss/.sass|.css    |.min.css |
|.less      |.css    |.min.css |
|.ts/.tsx   |.js(JSX) & .dev.js|.min.js &.dev.min.js |
|.js(ES6)   |.js(ES5) & .dev.js|.min.js &.dev.min.js |

Easy to use. When you writing a file, press save (<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>) to generate the compiled file in the same directory (or different if changed in the settings). No need for `gulp` or `webpack` or external helper tools.

# Configuration

## Compile-Hero settings view

You may want to use the command `Open settings` to open the settings on an easy to configure pane.

Right now, you could click on the "Features" tab, to list all available settings and commands.

## VSCode settings overview
Click to open the extension management interface (`Configure Extension Settings`), You can change the path of the project compilation directory, or enable/disable the compilation of any supported file format.

- Project-wide settings are configured using the standard `settings.json` file (i.e. Workspace Settings).

## Generate local default settings at project

You might want to locally modify the settings of this extension for easy modification/distribution with the project.

You can use the `Generate Compile-Superhero's default settings locally` command to generate it:
it will create a `.vscode/settings.json` or add missing entries, to your project folder.

# Open In Browser

Right click the `html` file in the directory menu, and the `open in browser` option will appear. You can preview the page using a fullfile path (security restrictions - not all might work) in the chrome browser only.

- But it would be better to use the [LiveServer by Ritwick Dey](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

# Close Port

At some point, you may be using ports for some services. If they are blocked, you can use the `close port` command to close them. (OSX/Linux, not Windows)
